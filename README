Requirements:
	Tested only on ubuntu. Needs c++11.

To compile:
	make

To run:
	./main [options=<values>]

	./main --file_name=<input-file>
		will run the processes in test_file. The Gantt Chart will print out in the file called output-<test_file>. Slashed are replaced by '-'.

	./main --file_name=<input-file> --user_quantum=<uq> --kernel_quantum=<kq> --scheduler=<protocol>
		will run the processes with user time-quantum=uq, kernel time-quantum=kq, and scheduler=protocol. The options for schedulers are {fifo, sjf, priority, edf}.

	./main --help
		to see all available options

	The --interactive flag will start an interactive session. Check it out on small inputs. You don't get to give any input, but you can step through each clock cycle and see how the processes progress.
Sample output:
	************* STATS *************
	NP: 99700
	AWT: 2511263.970
	ATT: 2516311.439

	And the Gantt-chart is found in 'output-<file-name>'. Slashes in the input filename are replaced with '-' in the output filename. The output file is stored in the same directory as the executable.
